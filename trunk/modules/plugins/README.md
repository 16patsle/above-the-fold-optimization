# WordPress Optimization Plugin Modules

The [Above The Fold Optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/above-the-fold-optimization/) plugin can be made compatible with any optimization, minification or full page cache plugin by creating a module extension. The plugin contains several modules by default for some of the most used plugins.

To add a module, you need to place the module in `/wp-content/themes/**YOUR_THEME_NAME**/abovethefold/plugins/**module-name**.inc.php` and optionally add a text file named `**module-name**.active.txt` with the WordPress plugin reference (usually `plugin-name/plugin-name.php`) which is used for fast checking the active state of the plugin.

Please submit new modules or suggestions to support new optimization plugins to info@pagespeed.pro.
