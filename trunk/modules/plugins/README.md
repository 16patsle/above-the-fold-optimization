# WordPress Optimization Plugin Modules

The [Above The Fold Optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/above-the-fold-optimization/) plugin can be made compatible with any optimization, full page cache and minification plugin by creating a module extension. 

The Above The Fold Optimization plugin contains modules for the most used optization plugins such as Autoptimize and W3 Total Cache.

To add a module, you need to place the module in `/wp-content/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/abovethefold/plugins/module.inc.php` and optionally add a text file named `module.active.txt` with the WordPress plugin reference (usually `plugin-name/plugin-name.php`) which is used for fast checking of the active state of the plugin.

Please submit new modules or suggestions to support new optimization plugins to info@pagespeed.pro.
